# Summer Internship at IIITNR 
## Overview
This repository contains the code and project reports from my enriching six-week summer internship at IIITNR College, where I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Mallikharjuna Rao. During this internship, I had the opportunity to explore the exciting domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Analysis.

## Week 1: Research Papers and Python Skills
In the first week, I dived into research papers on graph machine learning, link prediction, and searching algorithms. This helped me gain valuable insights into the latest developments in the field. Additionally, I honed my Python skills and familiarized myself with essential AI and ML libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

## Week 2: Understanding AI and ML Algorithms
During the second week, I deepened my understanding of AI and ML by studying the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. I learned about intelligent agents, search algorithms (A*, AO*, Minimax, and pruning), and their application in game-playing scenarios.

## Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing
Week 3 involved hands-on data analysis using real-world datasets from the NASA PROMISE repository, including CM1 and KM1 datasets. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into data distribution and relationships. Later, I focused on data preprocessing, handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

## Week 4: Software Reliability and Metaheuristic Algorithms
In the fourth week, I delved into Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) and explored optimization techniques like Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). I also started studying software reliability from the Springer Series in Reliability Engineering.

## Week 5: Implementing and Analyzing SRGMs
During Week 5, I implemented multiple SRGMs using Python and analyzed their performance. Among the models, the PNZ and Yamada-Rayleigh models performed the best in predicting software reliability.

## Week 6: Optimization Techniques and Hackathon Success
In the final week, I incorporated optimization techniques like ABC, PSO, and GA to improve the working of SRGMs. I also participated in a nationwide data analytics hackathon and secured the top position in the private leaderboard, applying my AI and ML skills.

# Conclusion and Gratitude
This summer internship has been an invaluable experience that has deepened my knowledge of AI, ML, and data analytics. I am thankful to Dr. Mallikharjuna Rao for his guidance and support throughout this journey. The projects and code in this repository showcase the culmination of my efforts during the internship.
